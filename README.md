Tic-Tac-Toe Game Development

I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python, providing players with an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience. Key aspects of the game and development process include:

1. Board Initialization and Printing:
   - Created a game board using a list data structure, representing the positions with blank spaces.
   - Implemented a function to print the current state of the board, allowing players to visualize the game progress.

2. Game Logic and Win Conditions:
   - Defined functions to check for win conditions, determining if a player has achieved three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
   - Implemented logic to detect a full board, signaling a tie when all positions are occupied without a winner.

3. Player and Computer Moves:
   - Facilitated player moves by accepting input for position selection and validating user inputs to ensure a valid move.
   - Incorporated a computer player with basic AI capabilities to make intelligent moves, aiming to block the player or secure a win whenever possible.

4. User Interface and Interaction:
   - Designed a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game, displaying the board and providing prompts for moves.
   - Utilized the `os` module to clear the console screen between moves, maintaining a clean and updated display.

5. Game Flow and Replayability:
   - Implemented a game loop to allow for continuous gameplay, enabling players to enjoy multiple rounds.
   - Provided an option for players to replay the game, enhancing the overall experience and engagement.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, game development concepts, and user interface design. It showcases my ability to create interactive applications that entertain and engage users effectively.
